Service Repository Server (SRS)
================

Proof of concept SRS.

This project forms part of a larger investigation into Dynamic Service Orchestration in the IP Multimedia Subsystem.

The Service Repository Server (SRS) is used to hold information about the available services that are on offer in the network. Traditionally a subset of this information would be manually programmed into the SCSF / other core network elements. However, with the proposed framework this information is trasmitted automatically to the SRS from the SIP AS.

There is no documentation at the moment. Please leave some feedback if you are interested in the project.
